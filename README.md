# Java_Projects
some java projects which I have worked on

some tips:

.jar executable is like .exe so you can run then just like .exe

.class can be run by java
like 
```cmd
java name
```
(where name is name.class)

.java is the source code and can also be run by java
```cmd
java name.java
```
also you can convert .java to .class using javac
```cmd
javac name.java
```
output is the name.class which java can also run
```cmd
java -jar name.jar
```
can be run by java too
